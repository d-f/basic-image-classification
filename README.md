# basic-image-classification

This is an example of image classification with TorchVision. [Disclaimer]: It should be noted that this model was trained / evaluated on 252 images and even though it shows impressive performance, it can't be assumed the model will work the same in a clinical setting without developing a large dataset with as little bias introduced as possible. This is also meant to be as simple of an example as possible, and doesn't include channel-wise pixel centering and normalization, transfer learning, fine tuning, or modern architectures such as EfficientNet.
